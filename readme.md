The current project offers a multilayered neural network interface based on Theano (and their excellent tutorial) and its application
to recipe classification. Of course the hope is to make it more general and useable for other classification tasks as well.
Currently nothing works.

To Do:

- Neural network interface
- Figure out and add comamand line arguents
- Create data analyser and parser class
- Create a script that calculates all the juicy statistics we all love, add visualisations, graphs, and so on.
